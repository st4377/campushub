✅ WHAT IS WORKING CORRECTLY (DESKTOP)

Sidebar structure is correct

<aside> is used only as a layout column

position: sticky is applied to an inner wrapper div (not the <aside>)

Sticky configuration is correct

Uses position: sticky

Uses top-28 to offset the header

Uses max-h-[calc(100vh-8rem)] to limit sidebar height

Internal scrolling is correct

Filter content scrolls inside the sidebar using overflow-y-auto

Filter header stays fixed inside the sidebar

No JavaScript scroll logic is used

✅ The desktop sidebar code itself should NOT be modified further.

❌ DESKTOP ISSUE THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE FIXED
Problem

On desktop, the filter sidebar does not remain pinned while scrolling the page.
Instead, it scrolls away with the content.

Root Cause (Confirmed)

position: sticky is being disabled by ancestor elements that use:

overflow: hidden;


According to CSS behavior, if any ancestor element of a sticky element has overflow: hidden, auto, or scroll, sticky positioning will not work.

Sticky fails silently — no error is shown.

🎯 REQUIRED FIX (DESKTOP ONLY)
1️⃣ Update client/src/pages/home.tsx
❌ Current (blocks sticky)
<motion.div className="relative w-full overflow-hidden border-b border-black/20">

✅ Required change
<motion.div className="relative w-full border-b border-black/20">


👉 Remove only overflow-hidden.
Do NOT change animations, structure, or layout.

2️⃣ Update layout wrapper (desktop page container)

Check the layout component (e.g. components/layout.tsx) and remove or replace any overflow-hidden applied to desktop page wrappers such as:

<div className="overflow-hidden">
<main className="overflow-hidden">

✅ Replace with

Remove overflow-hidden, or

Use overflow-visible

This change must apply to desktop page containers only.

🚫 WHAT MUST NOT BE CHANGED

Do NOT move sticky to <aside>

Do NOT add JavaScript scroll listeners

Do NOT use position: fixed

Do NOT change grid or layout structure

Do NOT touch mobile or tablet behavior

Do NOT remove animations

✅ EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX

On desktop, the filter sidebar stays pinned while scrolling

Sidebar stops when main content ends

Filter content scrolls internally if long

Behavior matches the original working version
